#  Tech Haven üåê

Tech Haven is a sophisticated e-commerce platform designed to cater to a wide range of electronic products, including laptops, headphones, mobile phones, speakers, TVs, and Bluetooth devices.

This project served as an in-depth learning experience, significantly enhancing my skills in Django and e-commerce development.
