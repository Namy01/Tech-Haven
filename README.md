üåê Tech Haven
Tech Haven is a sophisticated e-commerce platform designed to cater to a wide range of electronic products, including laptops, headphones, mobile phones, speakers, TVs, and Bluetooth devices. Utilizing the Molla template for frontend design, I, Namrata Neupane, was solely responsible for the entire backend development. This project served as an in-depth learning experience, significantly enhancing my skills in Django and e-commerce development.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Molla template)

Backend: Django

Database: SQLite

Purpose: The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of Django and the complexities involved in building a fully functional e-commerce platform. This endeavor provided an excellent opportunity to implement and experiment with various features, including product management, user authentication, and dynamic pricing.

Feel free to explore the codebase and provide any feedback or suggestions!
